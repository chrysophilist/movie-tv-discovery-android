# Privacy Policy

**Last updated:** January 2026

### Introduction
This Privacy Policy explains how *Cinemon* (“the app”) handles user data.

The app helps users discover movies and TV shows and view information about where they are legally available to stream. We respect user privacy and are committed to transparency regarding data handling.

### Data Collection & Safety
* **No Personal Data is Collected:** The app does not collect, store, upload, or transmit any personal user data to the developer or any developer-controlled server.
* **No Data Sharing:** No user data is shared with third parties, advertisers, or analytics providers.
  However, the app allows users to **voluntarily provide a third-party API key (Watchmode API key)** to enable content retrieval.
  **Note:** The API key is stored locally on the user’s device using Android’s private app storage.


### User-Provided Data
To enable content retrieval, the app allows users to voluntarily input a Watchmode API Key.
* **Storage:** This key is stored locally on your device using Android’s secure internal storage
* **Usage:** The key is used exclusively to authenticate direct network requests from your device to the Watchmode API.
* **Access:** The developer has no access to this key. It is never transmitted to any server other than the official Watchmode API endpoints.

### Permissions
* **INTERNET:** Required to make network requests to the Watchmode API.

### Data Retention & Deletion
* Since no user data is transmitted to the developer, there is no remote data to delete.
* **Local Deletion:** Users can permanently delete their stored API key and all cached data by clearing the app’s storage in Android Settings or by uninstalling the app.

### Third-Party Services
The app interacts directly with the following third-party service:
* **Watchmode API:** Used to retrieve movie, TV show, and streaming availability information.
* **Note:** Users are responsible for reviewing Watchmode’s own Privacy Policy and Terms of Service regarding their API usage.

### Advertising & Analytics
* **No Ads:** The app does not display advertisements.
* **No Analytics:** The app does not use analytics software to track user behavior.

### Children’s Privacy
The app does not knowingly collect personal data from children under the age of 13.

### Changes to This Policy
This Privacy Policy may be updated to reflect changes in app functionality or legal requirements. Any updates will be published at the same location.
